# Pipeline Sports Performance Member Management and Facility Data Warehouse

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

The Pipeline Sports Performance Member Management and Facility Data Warehouse web application is focused on creating software that improves the workflow of coaches and provides useful information to members. This document details the technical side of the application, including security, testing, use cases, our development process, requirements, development, and deployment. It is important to mention that our team’s approach is slightly more long sighted due to the expected future of the application being a out-in-the-world piece of software that will need to be maintained.
